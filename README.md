# d3js-bargraph

I have used sublime text IDE to write a code from scratch.
Create simple index.html file and add two cdn library
  Here is a link

      Next we need sample csv format data. You can also use JSON data.
      
    To run the code in google chrome you will get error like this
        d3.min.js:1 XMLHttpRequest cannot load
        Cross origin requests are only supported for protocol schemes: http, data, chrome, chrome-extension, https, chrome-extension-resource.
        
        To avoid this error you must have to run the code from any local server. For example like XAMPP or WAMP
        
        
        And ready to go.
